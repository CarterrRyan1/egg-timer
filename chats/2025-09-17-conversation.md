**User:** I want to decide what tasks need to be done to develop the app and each tasl has to deliver a still functioning and fully working solution at the end

**Copilot:** Here’s a suggested breakdown of tasks for developing your egg timer app, with each step resulting in a fully working solution:
1. Create a basic timer UI and functionality
2. Add preset timer buttons for common egg types
3. Implement sound or notification when the timer finishes
4. Enhance the UI with a progress bar or visual countdown
5. Make the app responsive and mobile-friendly
6. Add accessibility improvements
7. Optional: Allow saving favorite times or running multiple timers
Would you like to proceed with this plan, or adjust/add any steps?

**User:** i want you to make a prd md file and place it in a docs dir

**Copilot:** A Product Requirements Document (PRD) for your egg timer app has been created as `docs/PRD.md` in the project. It outlines the app’s goals, features, milestones, and success criteria. Let me know if you want to review or update any part of it!

**User:** okay make an md file for each of the tasks and place it in the tasks dir

**Copilot:** Task markdown files have been created for each development phase in the `tasks` directory. Each file describes the objective, requirements, and acceptance criteria for its step, ensuring a fully working solution at the end of each task.
