# Conversation: Egg Timer development (2025-09-17)

This file is an archived copy of the conversation between you and the assistant while working on the Egg Timer project.

---

User: using the attatched task 1 md file and you can see i have imported vue, i want to get started with task1 (See <attachments> above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again.)

Assistant: Added a todo list and implemented the timer UI in `index.html` (inputs for minutes/seconds, display, Start/Pause/Reset buttons). Asked whether to proceed with logic.

User: yes do the logic

Assistant: Marked todo progress and implemented timer logic in `timer.js` (Vue instance with `minutes`, `seconds`, `totalSeconds`, `isRunning`, `startTimer`, `pauseTimer`, `resetTimer`, `countdown`, `displayTime` computed, and watchers). Offered to connect UI and test.

User: tailwind isnt working

Assistant: Investigated files. Found `index.html` referenced `src/output.css` and `src/` contained `input.css` and `output.css`. Launched a Tailwind build watch (`npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css --watch`) in the terminal and reported it was running.

User: generate npm start script

Assistant: Updated `package.json` to add `start` and `dev` scripts that build Tailwind and serve the site (using `npx serve`), and explained how to run them.

User: tailwind styling doesnt appear to be applying properly

Assistant: Planned actions: add Tailwind config, fix `v-model` typo, rebuild `output.css`. Fixed the HTML typo (`v-odel` -> `v-model`) and added `tailwind.config.js`. Rebuilt `src/output.css` and started `serve`. Confirmed server at `http://localhost:3000` and noted how to check styles in DevTools.

User: remove all instances of tailwind in this project i will use vanilla css for now

Assistant: Created a todo list for removing Tailwind. Replaced the stylesheet link in `index.html` to `styles.css`, added a vanilla `styles.css` with replacements for the Tailwind classes used, removed Tailwind config, cleared `src/input.css` contents (replaced Tailwind directives with a comment), attempted to delete generated `src/output.css`, updated `package.json` scripts to use `npx serve .` only and removed Tailwind dependencies, and deleted `package-lock.json` so it won't reference Tailwind. Provided next-steps for the user (uninstall tailwind packages locally, and starting server).

User: save this conversation as md in chats dir

Assistant: (this file) The conversation has been saved to `chats/2025-09-17-conversation-egg-timer.md` inside the project.
